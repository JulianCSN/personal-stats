# PERSONAL STATS WEB PAGE

This is a personal web application that showcases the statistics of my life, like the concerts I've attended and other interesting data points that I come up with. This website serves as a creative outlet for me to practice and enhance my design and development skills using React and Next.js.

## Purpose
The main goal of Personal Stats is to serve as a sandbox for practicing and experimenting with modern web development technologies. By working on this project, I aim to refine my skills in React, Next.js, and design, ultimately becoming a more proficient front-end developer.

* Feel free to customize this presentation to better suit your style and preferences.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
